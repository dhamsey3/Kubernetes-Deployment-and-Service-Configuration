# Kubernetes Deployment and Service Configuration

## Description

This repository provides configurations for deploying and managing a GeoServices application on a Kubernetes cluster. It includes detailed instructions and templates for containerizing the application using Docker, setting up Kubernetes deployments and services, and configuring the web application.

## Key Features

1. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Containerizes the GeoServices application.
   - Specifies the base image, working directory, file copy instructions, necessary installations, exposed ports, environment variables, and the command to run the application.

2. **Kubernetes Deployment Configuration**:
   - Manages the deployment and scaling of the application within the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Defines the number of pod replicas, pod selection criteria, and template for pod creation, including container settings, resource allocation, and health checks.

3. **Kubernetes Service Configuration**:
   - Exposes the application within the Kubernetes network.
   - Specifies pod selection criteria, port mappings, and the type of service (e.g., ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).

4. **GeoServices Application**:
   - Provides various geospatial services and capabilities.
   - Includes instructions on how to use, configure, and scale the application within Kubernetes.
   - Details on data sources, data management, and security protocols.

5. **Web Application**:
   - Contains a Flask web application running within the Docker container.
   - Describes the functionalities and features of the web application.

## Deployment and Service Interaction

Explains how the Kubernetes Deployment and Service configurations work together to manage the application lifecycle and expose it to the network.

## Troubleshooting

Provides guidelines and tips for diagnosing and resolving common issues that may arise during deployment and service configuration.

## Testing

# Testing the Kubernetes Deployment and Service

This document provides commands and instructions for testing and verifying the GeoServices application deployment on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Testing Commands

1. **Check the status of pods**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
2. **Check the status of services**:
   ```sh
   kubectl get services
3. **Check the logs of a specific pod**:
   ```sh
   kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
4. **Execute a command in a running pod:**:
   ```sh
   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
