My portfolio app with python

# Requirements
1. Python
2. Docker
3. Html
4. Kubernetes

To create a Python app with Docker, you will need to follow these basic steps:

1.	Write your Python code: First, write your Python code using your preferred IDE or text editor. Ensure that the code is working correctly and includes all necessary dependencies.

2.	Create a Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image to use, the files to include, and any commands to run during the build process. Here is a basic Dockerfile to get you started:
bashCopy code

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image FROM python:3.9-slim-buster # Set the working directory to /app WORKDIR /app # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app COPY . /app # Install the required packages RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container EXPOSE 8080 # Define environment variable ENV NAME World # Run the command to start the application CMD ["python", "app.py"] 

3.	Build the Docker image: Once you have created the Dockerfile, you can use the docker build command to build the Docker image. Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:


docker build -t myapp . 

This command will create a Docker image named myapp using the Dockerfile in the current directory.

4.	Run the Docker container: After building the Docker image, you can use the docker run command to start the container. Use the following command to start the container:

docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp 

This command will start the container and map port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 in the container. You can now access your Python app by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

That's it! You now have a Python app running in a Docker container. Of course, this is just a basic example, and you can customize the Dockerfile and build process to suit your specific needs.

# Deployment on kubernetes

Sure, here are the steps to deploy a Python app with a Docker container and expose it on port 5000 in a Kubernetes cluster:

Containerize your Python app: Follow the steps I provided in my previous response to containerize your Python app with Docker and expose it on port 5000.


Create a Kubernetes deployment: Create a Kubernetes deployment YAML file, Deployment.yaml, with the following contents:


This YAML file defines a deployment for your app with 3 replicas, and specifies that each replica should run the myapp container image with port 5000 exposed.

Create a Kubernetes service: Create a Kubernetes service YAML file, service.yaml, with the following contents:

This YAML file defines a service for your app that routes traffic to pods with the label app: myapp. It also exposes port 80 for external access, which will be mapped to port 5000 of the container.

Apply the YAML files to Kubernetes: Apply the deployment and service YAML files to Kubernetes using the kubectl apply command:



kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml


This will create a deployment with 3 replicas of your app and a service that exposes it on port 5000 to the internet.

That's it! Your Python app is now running in a Kubernetes cluster and accessible on port 5000. Remember that these are just basic examples, and you can customize the deployment and service YAML files to fit your specific needs
