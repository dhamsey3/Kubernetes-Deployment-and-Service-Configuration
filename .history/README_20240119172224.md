# Kubernetes Deployment and Service Configuration

This README provides an overview and documentation of the Kubernetes Deployment and Service configurations for your application.

## Docker Configuration (`Dockerfile`)

### Overview
The `Dockerfile` defines how your application should be packaged and executed within a Docker container.

### Key Components
- `FROM`: Specifies the base image for your Docker container. In this example, we use an official Python 3.9 Alpine Linux image.

- `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory within the container to `/app`, where your application files will be placed.

- `COPY`: Copies the contents of the current directory into the container's `/app` directory.

- `RUN`: Installs any required packages listed in `requirements.txt` within the container.

- `EXPOSE`: Exposes port 5000 for your Flask application to listen on.

- `ENV`: Defines an environment variable `FLASK_APP` with the value `app.py`.

- `CMD`: Specifies the command to run when the container is launched, starting your Flask application.

## Deployment Configuration (`Deployment.yaml`)

### Overview
The `Deployment.yaml` file describes how your Docker containerized application should be deployed and scaled within a Kubernetes cluster.

### Key Components
- `replicas`: Specifies the desired number of pod replicas for your application. In this example, we have set it to 3 for redundancy and load balancing.

- `selector`: Defines which pods this Deployment should manage. It uses labels to match pods. Ensure that your pods are labeled with `app: my-app` for this Deployment to work correctly.

- `template`: Specifies the blueprint for creating pods.
  - `metadata`: Labels are used to identify pods created by this Deployment with `app: my-app`.
  - `containers`: Defines the container(s) to run within the pods, including the base image and exposed ports.
  - `resources`: Resource requests and limits are set to allocate CPU and memory resources to each pod.
  - `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`: These probes check the health and readiness of the container by sending HTTP requests to the root path of your application on port `5000`.

## Service Configuration (`Service.yaml`)

### Overview
The `Service.yaml` file defines how your Docker containerized application should be exposed to the network within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Key Components
- `selector`: Specifies the pods to include in the service. Ensure that it matches the label used in the Deployment (`app: my-app`).

- `ports`: Maps incoming traffic on port 80 to the pods' port 5000. This enables external or internal clients to access your application through the Service's IP address and port 80.

- `type`: Sets the type of the service. In this example, it's set to `LoadBalancer`, allowing external access to your application through a cloud provider's load balancer.

## GeoServices Application

The Kubernetes deployment hosts a GeoServices application, which provides geospatial services and capabilities. Here are some key points to understand about the application:

- **Functionality**: The GeoServices app is designed to offer a range of geospatial services, such as mapping, location-based queries, geocoding, or any other geospatial operations specific to its use case.

- **Usage**: Specify how users or other services can interact with the GeoServices application. Provide any relevant endpoints, APIs, or documentation for accessing these services.

- **Configuration**: Describe any specific configuration or settings required for the GeoServices app to function correctly within the Kubernetes environment. This may include environment variables, data sources, or external dependencies.

- **Scaling**: Explain how the Kubernetes Deployment configuration ensures that the GeoServices app can scale horizontally to handle increased demand for geospatial services.

- **Data**: Mention any data sources or datasets that the GeoServices app relies on. Consider whether data synchronization or updates are part of its setup.

- **Security**: Address security considerations for geospatial data and services, including access control, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.

By providing details about the GeoServices application, you can offer clear guidance on how others can utilize and interact with these geospatial services within the Kubernetes cluster.

## Website

Your website is the main application that runs inside the Docker container. It is a Flask web application that listens on port 5000.

## Deployment and Service Interaction

- The Deployment ensures the desired number of application pods are running, manages scaling, and maintains high availability.

- The Service selects pods based on their labels and exposes them to the network. It provides load balancing and service discovery for your application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following:
- Check container logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name> -c <container-name>` for error messages.
- Ensure resource limits, application configuration, and dependencies are correctly set.
- Review the Deployment and Service configurations for any inconsistencies.
- Monitor progress using `kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment`.

Feel free to modify these configurations as needed for your specific application requirements.
